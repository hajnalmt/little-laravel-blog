## Initial setup

This project was created with Laravel, in a WSL2 environment through Windows with sail.
For more information please visit the official [Getting started guide](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#getting-started-on-windows) on the laravel home page.

To learn sail, there is an official [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#introduction) for it too.

If you are familiar with the basic docker concepts already, and managed to install it on your machine, than you don't need to fuss with composer and php installations. After you cloned the repository just enter the command:

```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/opt \
    -w /opt \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

If you stumble upon some dns issue you might need to add the --dns 8.8.8.8 flag to the command. (This is due to some WSL2 dns handling error, but I won't dive into now.):

```
docker run --rm \
    --dns 8.8.8.8 \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/opt \
    -w /opt \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

If you have the bash alias for sail set already:

```
alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'
```

then enter

```
sail up
```

and on [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) the application shall be ready.

On mac and linux you should be fine, but if you have dns issues with the last command still, then please add the google DNS server to your /etc/resolv.conf file:

```
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf
```

Hope this helped!

## About Laravel

<p><a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laravel/art/master/logo-lockup/5%20SVG/2%20CMYK/1%20Full%20Color/laravel-logolockup-cmyk-red.svg" width="400"></a></p>

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
